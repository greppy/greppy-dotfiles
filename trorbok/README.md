trorbok
=======

trorbok is an IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad T60 running [ArchLinux](http://archlinux.org).
It was purchased used from [UW SWAP](http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/swap/) with no
OS, but an 80GB hdd and 1.5GB of RAM.

My goal for this machine is to be either a breakbox, something I can try
things out on without worrying if it gets fubared, or as my primary amateur
radio machine, both for rig control and logging.
