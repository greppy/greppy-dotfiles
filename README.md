greppy-dotfiles
===============

Obligitory dotfiles for various applications and systems.

The goal is to have a unified set of files that will give a consistant
environment on most, if not all of the systems that I use.

Comments in the various files may or may not make sense, if they exist :)

Feel free to copy anything in these dotfiles, I most likely got the settings
from either a man page or someone else sharing what they had done.
